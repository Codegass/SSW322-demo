2024 Summer Olympics

The 2024 Summer Olympics (French: Les Jeux Olympiques d'été de 2024), officially the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad (French: Jeux de la XXXIIIe olympiade de l'ère moderne) and branded as Paris 2024, were an international multi-sport event held from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in France, with several events started from 24 July. Paris was the host city, with events (mainly football) held in 16 additional cities spread across metropolitan France, including the sailing centre in the second-largest city of France, Marseille, on the Mediterranean Sea, as well as one subsite for surfing in Tahiti, French Polynesia.[4]

Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both bids were praised for their high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris became the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the games in 1908, 1948, and 2012).[5][6] Paris 2024 marked the centenary of Paris 1924 and Chamonix 1924 (the first Winter Olympics), as well as the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics) and the first with this distinction since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. The Summer Games returned to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Paris 2024 featured the debut of breaking as an Olympic sport,[7] and was the final Olympic Games held during the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach.[8] The 2024 Games were expected to cost €9 billion.[9][10][11] The opening ceremony was held outside of a stadium for the first time in modern Olympic history, as athletes were paraded by boat along the Seine. Paris 2024 was the first Olympics in history to reach full gender parity on the field of play, with equal numbers of male and female athletes.[12]

The United States topped the medal table for the fourth consecutive Summer Games and 19th time overall, with 40 gold and 126 total medals.[13] 
China tied with the United States on gold (40), but finished second due to having fewer silvers; the nation won 91 medals overall. 
This is the first time a gold medal tie among the two most successful nations has occurred in Summer Olympic history.[14] Japan finished third with 20 gold medals and sixth in the overall medal count. Australia finished fourth with 18 gold medals and fifth in the overall medal count. The host nation, France, finished fifth with 16 gold and 64 total medals, and fourth in the overall medal count. Dominica, Saint Lucia, Cape Verde and Albania won their first-ever Olympic medals, the former two both being gold, with Botswana and Guatemala also winning their first-ever gold medals. 
The Refugee Olympic Team also won their first-ever medal, a bronze in boxing. At the conclusion of the games, despite some controversies throughout relating to politics, logistics and conditions in the Olympic Village, the Games were considered a success by the press, Parisians and observers.[a] The Paris Olympics broke all-time records for ticket sales, with more than 9.5 million tickets sold (12.1 million including the Paralympic Games).[15]

Medals
Medals from the Games, with a piece of the Eiffel Tower
The President of the Paris 2024 Olympic Organizing Committee, Tony Estanguet, unveiled the Olympic and Paralympic medals for the Games in February 2024, which on the obverse featured embedded hexagon-shaped tokens of scrap iron that had been taken from the original construction of the Eiffel Tower, with the logo of the Games engraved into it.[41] Approximately 5,084 medals would be produced by the French mint Monnaie de Paris, and were designed by Chaumet, a luxury jewellery firm based in Paris.[42]

The reverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, inside the Panathenaic Stadium which hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896. Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower can also be seen in the background on both sides of the medal.[43] Each medal weighs 455–529 g (16–19 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 9.2 mm (0.36 in) thick.[44] The gold medals are made with 98.8 percent silver and 1.13 percent gold, while the bronze medals are made up with copper, zinc, and tin.[45]


Opening ceremony

Pyrotechnics at the Pont d'Austerlitz marking the start of the Parade of Nations

The opening ceremony began at 19:30 CEST (17:30 GMT) on 26 July 2024.[124] Directed by Thomas Jolly,[125][126][127] it was the first Summer Olympics opening ceremony to be held outside the traditional stadium setting (and the second ever after the 2018 Youth Olympic Games one, held at Plaza de la República in Buenos Aires); the parade of athletes was conducted as a boat parade along the Seine from Pont d'Austerlitz to Pont d'Iéna, and cultural segments took place at various landmarks along the route.[128] Jolly stated that the ceremony would highlight notable moments in the history of France, with an overall theme of love and "shared humanity".[128] The athletes then attended the official protocol at Jardins du Trocadéro, in front of the Eiffel Tower.[129] Approximately 326,000 tickets were sold for viewing locations along the Seine, 222,000 of which were distributed primarily to the Games' volunteers, youth and low-income families, among others.[130]

The ceremony featured music performances by American musician Lady Gaga,[131] French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, heavy metal band Gojira and soprano Marina Viotti [fr],[132] Axelle Saint-Cirel (who sang the French national anthem "La Marseillaise" atop the Grand Palais),[133] rapper Rim'K,[134] Philippe Katerine (who portrayed the Greek god Dionysus), Juliette Armanet and Sofiane Pamart, and was closed by Canadian singer Céline Dion.[132] The Games were formally opened by president Emmanuel Macron.[135]

The Olympics and Paralympics cauldron was lit by Guadeloupean judoka Teddy Riner and sprinter Marie-José Pérec; it had a hot air balloon-inspired design topped by a 30-metre-tall (98 ft) helium sphere, and was allowed to float into the air above the Tuileries Garden at night. For the first time, the cauldron was not illuminated through combustion; the flames were simulated by an LED lighting system and aerosol water jets.[136]

Controversy ensued at the opening ceremony when a segment was interpreted by some as a parody of the Last Supper. The organisers apologised for any offence caused.[137] The Olympic World Library and fact-checkers would later debunk the interpretation that the segment was a parody of the Last Supper. The Olympic flag was also raised upside down.[138][139]

During the day of the opening ceremony, there were reports of a blackout in Paris, although this was later debunked.[140]

Closing ceremony

The closing ceremony was held at Stade de France on 11 August 2024, and thus marked the first time in any Olympic edition since Sarajevo 1984 that opening and closing ceremonies were held in different locations.[127] Titled "Records", the ceremony was themed around a dystopian future, where the Olympic Games have disappeared, and a group of aliens reinvent it. It featured more than a hundred performers, including acrobats, dancers and circus artists.[158] American actor Tom Cruise also appeared with American performers Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and H.E.R. during the LA28 Handover Celebration portion of the ceremony.[159][160] The Antwerp Ceremony, in which the Olympic flag was handed to Los Angeles, the host city of the 2028 Summer Olympics, was produced by Ben Winston and his studio Fulwell 73.[161]


Security
France reached an agreement with Europol and the UK Home Office to help strengthen security and "facilitate operational information exchange and international law enforcement cooperation" during the Games.[46] The agreement included a plan to deploy more drones and sea barriers to prevent small boats from crossing the Channel illegally.[47] The British Army would also provide support by deploying Starstreak surface-to-air missile units for air security.[48] To prepare for the Games, the Paris police held inspections and rehearsals in their bomb disposal unit, similar to their preparations for the 2023 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France.[49]

As part of a visit to France by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, several agreements were signed between the two nations to enhance security for the Olympics.[50] In preparation for the significant security demands and counterterrorism measures, Poland pledged to contribute security troops, including sniffer dog handlers, to support international efforts aimed at ensuring the safety of the Games.[51][52] The Qatari Minister of Interior and Commander of Lekhwiya (the Qatari security forces) convened a meeting on 3 April 2024 to discuss security operations ahead of the Olympics, with officials and security leaders in attendance, including Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Sheikh Jassim bin Mansour Al Thani.[53] A week before the opening ceremony, the Lekhwiya were reported to have been deployed in Paris on 16 July 2024.[54]

In the weeks running up to the opening of the Paris Olympics, it was reported that police officers would be deployed from Belgium,[55] Brazil,[56] Canada (through the RCMP/OPP/CPS/SQ),[57][58][59] Cyprus,[60] the Czech Republic,[61] Denmark,[62] Estonia,[63][64] Finland,[65] Germany (through Bundespolizei[66][67]/NRW Police[68]),[69] India,[70][71] Ireland,[72] Italy,[73] Luxembourg,[74] Morocco,[75] Netherlands,[76] Norway,[58] Poland,[77] Portugal,[78] Slovakia,[79] South Korea,[80][81] Spain (through the CNP/GC),[82] Sweden,[83] the UAE,[84] the UK,[49] and the US (through the LAPD,[85] LASD,[86] NYPD,[87] and the Fairfax County Police Department[88]), with more than 40 countries providing police assistance to their French counterparts.[89][90]

Security concerns impacted the plans that had been announced for the opening ceremony, which was to take place as a public event along the Seine; the expected attendance was reduced by half from an estimated 600,000 to 300,000, with plans for free viewing locations now being by invitation only. In April 2024, after Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack in March, and made several threats against the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, French president Emmanuel Macron indicated that the opening ceremony could be scaled back or re-located if necessary.[91][92][93] French authorities had placed roughly 75,000 police and military officials on the streets of Paris in the lead-up to the Games.[94]

Following the end of the Games, the national counterterrorism prosecutor, Olivier Christen, revealed that French authorities foiled three terror plots meant to attack the Olympic and Paralympic Games, resulting in the arrest of five suspects.[95]
